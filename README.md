Data preprocessing is an essential step before building a Machine Learning model and Analysis. 

In this program, I started analyzing the text data from the book *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll* with using python library NLTK. Natural Language Toolkit is a common Preprocessing Methods for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
